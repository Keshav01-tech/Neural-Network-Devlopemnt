# Neural-Network-Devlopemnt
Neural network creation means designing, training, and validating a model that maps inputs to outputs through layered neurons to solve a specific task like classification or regression. At a high level: define the problem and data, preprocess and split it, choose an architecture, train with a loss/optimizer, evaluate, and deploy
